# UIUCinternship

This repo contains the code used during my internship with HPCBio group in UCIC. It can be considered supplementary to the pipeline in HPCBio/BW_VariantCalling (ParameterSweep branch). The branches of this repo are the code used for:

- Experiment with parameters with various GATK pipeline tools
- The generation of synthetic datasets using: https://github.com/zstephens/neat-genreads
- Download of data from GIAB and testing on them
